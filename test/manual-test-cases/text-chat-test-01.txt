Procedure: 
Enter the following items (each separated by ---) into the text chat window "Compose" text area.
Press "Send" after each one.

Expected behavior: Related text and and image should appear in the chat log.

You can add a limited subset of HTML.

But you can't use scripts:<br>
<script>alert("hello from JavaScript!");</script>

The script should have been turned into a "span" tag.
