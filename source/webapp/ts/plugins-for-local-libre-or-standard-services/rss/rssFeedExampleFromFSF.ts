The\r\nRYF certification mark means that the product meets the FSF's\r\nstandards in regard to users' freedom, control over the product, and\r\nprivacy.\r\n</description>\n <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<img alt=\"Libreboot T400\" src=\"https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/ryf/libreboot-t400.jpg\" style=\"float: right; width: 250px; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;\" />\n\n<p>This is the third Libreboot-series laptop from Minifree (formerly\nknown as Gluglug) to achieve <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/ryf\">RYF certification</a>, the first being\nthe <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/gluglug-x60-laptop-now-certified-to-respect-your-freedom\">Libreboot X60</a> in December 2013, followed by the <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/libreboot-x200-laptop-now-fsf-certified-to-respect-your-freedom\">Libreboot\nX200</a> in January 2015. The Libreboot T400 can be purchased from\nMinifree at <a href=\"http://minifree.org/product/libreboot-t400/\">http://minifree.org/product/libreboot-t400/</a>.</p>\n<p>The Libreboot T400 is a refurbished and updated laptop based on the\nLenovo ThinkPad T400. Just as with the Libreboot X200, in order to\nachieve the Free Software Foundation's RYF certification guidelines,\nMinifree had to replace the low-level firmware as well as the\noperating system. Microsoft Windows was replaced with the\n<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html\">FSF-endorsed</a> <a href=\"https://trisquel.info/\">Trisquel GNU/Linux</a> operating system, which\nincludes the GNOME 3 desktop environment. The free software boot\nsystem of <a href=\"http://libreboot.org/\">Libreboot</a> and the GNU GRUB 2 bootloader were adapted to\nreplace the stock proprietary firmware, which included a BIOS and\nIntel's Management Engine firmware.</p>\n<p>The mission of both Libreboot and Minifree is to push the free\nsoftware movement forward in a fundamental way, at the hardware and\nfirmware level.</p>\n<p>\"While we don't require that companies selling Respects Your Freedom\ncertified products also develop or fund free software projects\ndirectly, in the case of Minifree, sales of their products do directly\nfund the Libreboot project. It is doubly exciting to be able to\nendorse a new freedom-respecting hardware product while also\nencouraging people to support the development of an important free\nsoftware project,\" said FSF's licensing &amp; compliance manager, Joshua\nGay.</p>\n<p>\"We call on more people and companies to get involved with Libreboot\ndevelopment. We also need hardware manufacturers to cooperate. This is\na long battle, and one that the Libreboot project has taken on. We're\ndoing this because we believe users deserve to have full control over\ntheir own computing, and the freedom to share with others,\" said\nFrancis Rowe, founder of Minifree and lead maintainer of Libreboot.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the Respects Your Freedom hardware certification,\nincluding details on the certification of the Libreboot T400, visit\n<a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/ryf\">https://www.fsf.org/ryf</a>.

Because of this, users of a wide variety of software and\r\ndevices, such as ebook readers and video game consoles, still do not\r\nhave the right to control their own computing. Even for the areas\r\nwhere the exemptions permit users some additional control, they do not\r\npermit sharing of methods for obtaining it, and last only three years.\r\n</description>\n <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The DMCA contains provisions penalizing the circumvention of\n\"technological protection measures\". These measures are digital jails\ndenying users access to the software and other digital works they\npossess, preventing them from examining or changing the software on\ntheir devices. While such measures are nominally meant to protect\ncopyrighted works, in reality they function as unacceptable\nrestrictions on computer user freedom. The Free Software Foundation\n(FSF) opposes such Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) systems. The\nFSF further opposes the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions, and\ndemands that Congress repeal those provisions. Other countries with\nsimilar laws should follow suit.</p>\n<p>Every three years, the Library of Congress reviews proposals granting\nlimited exemptions from the DMCA's broad ban on users controlling the\nsoftware and data on devices encumbered with DRM. This\n<a href=\"https://www.defectivebydesign.org/DMCA-exemption-commenting-process-broken\">flawed process</a> is meant to lessen the DMCA's harm by giving user\nrights advocates an opportunity to request exemptions allowing\ncircumvention in particular cases. Even when such petitions succeed,\nthe resulting exemptions last only three years, meaning that advocates\nmust repeatedly fight to retain the limited ground they won.</p>\n<p>In the round that just concluded, the\n<a href=\"https://www.defectivebydesign.org/end-DMCA-anti-circumvention-provisions\">Free Software Foundation demanded that the Library of Congress grant every proposed exemption</a>.\nIn each comment, we explained the importance of free software;\nsoftware that \"users are free to study, share and improve,\" which\nenables users to enjoy the universal right of controlling their own\ncomputing. Users have the right to modify and access all software they\npossess, regardless of its purpose or on what device it runs. Since\nDRM requires proprietary software to take control of a user's computer\naway from her, it is fundamentally incompatible with a fully free\nworld. Users cannot enjoy their rights so long as DRM cages them and\nthe DMCA threatens them to stay in the cage. There should be no\npenalties for users controlling their own software or for sharing\ntools to help others do the same.</p>\n<p>Before outlining the <a href=\"http://copyright.gov/1201/2015/fedreg-publicinspectionFR.pdf\">list of exemptions</a>, the Library of Congress\nprovides a clear warning (one that did not appear in previous\nexemption rulemaking documents) that the potential scope of its\nexemptions is limited by law. Specifically, it makes clear that under\nSection 1201, it cannot make it legal for a person to share her\nmethods for circumventing some digital restriction technology,\nincluding \"products and services that are used to circumvent\ntechnological measures that control access to copyrighted works (for\nexample, a password needed to open a media file),\" or \"products and\nservices used to circumvent technological measures that protect the\nexclusive rights of the copyright owner in their works (for example,\ntechnology that prevents the work from being reproduced).\" (p. 5) It\nclaims that the sharing of passwords and software is illegal\ntrafficking and that it will take an act of Congress to change\nthis. Even if the Library of Congress believes it cannot grant such\nexemptions, it does have the power to recommend that Congress to\ncorrect this fatal flaw.</p>\n<p>Advocates did succeed in securing several important exemptions. The\n<a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/oct/27/DMCA-win/\">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> successfully won back some rights\nfor Smart TV owners. Although the exemption granted for Smart TVs is\nnarrower than what was requested, it allows users to circumvent DRM\nfor the sole purpose of enabling interoperability of programs on their\nSmart TVs. The <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/victory-users-librarian-congress-renews-and-expands-protections-fair-uses\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> was also victorious\nin several proposed exemptions. Users of tablets and multi-player\nvideo games run via servers, for example, now have exemptions\nprotecting some of their uses. Many other users had their previously\ngranted exemptions maintained, such as those related to cell\nphones. The FSF supported these exemptions because they carve out a\nlittle more space for user freedom. These victories are a testament to\nthe dedication and hard work of advocates in the face of a difficult\nsystem. In other areas, however, change was even more limited.</p>\n<p>For example, while the Library of Congress granted an exemption\nrelated to software on motor vehicles and farming equipment, it\nlimited this exemption to only the owners of the vehicles. Thus, while\nusers may circumvent DRM on their own vehicles, they may not ask third\nparties to do the work. For many users, not being able to have third\nparties access software for them is in practice just as bad as not\nbeing able to do it themselves, and denies them fundamental rights of\nassociation and expression. The exemption also does not extend to\n\"computer programs primarily designed for the control of telematics or\nentertainment systems\" (p. 43), therefore blocking installation of\nmany legitimately useful free software programs.</p>\n<p>Further, the Library of Congress limited the exemption in light of\nregulations unrelated to copyright . In its statement, it says \"while\nfrom a copyright perspective proponents had made the case for an\nexemption, based on the record, the exemption needed to be carefully\ntailored\". (p. 42) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) opposed\nany exemption for motor vehicles, attempting to shoehorn its own\nduties regarding emissions control into what is nominally an act\nrelated to copyright. This is despite the fact that the\n<a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/epa-opposed-dmca-exemptions-that-could-have-revealed-volkswagen-fraud\">anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA actually helped hide unlawful activity by Volkswagen</a>\nin which they used proprietary software in order to trick EPA tests on\nemissions. If users and researchers had been permitted to access the\nsoftware on their own vehicles, they may have discovered Volkswagen's\nfraud years earlier than the EPA did.</p>\n<p>Interference from other government agencies, such as the Food and Drug\nAdministration, is found throughout the statement on exemptions. These\nagencies are not tasked with enforcing copyright. Instead, they are\ntrying to use the DMCA's penalties to control users regardless of\nwhether any crime occurs. The government should not presume that all\nusers are guilty of violating the law, and should not punish all users\nin its quest to enforce the law against the few who might break it.\nBut using DRM to enforce the law does just that, as DRM blocks ethical\nand lawful activities. That government agencies are attempting to use\nthe DMCA to punish and control users based on regulations wholly\nunrelated to copyright demonstrates that DRM has nothing to do with\nrights, and everything to do with restriction.</p>\n<p>While users might feel relief in receiving some exemptions, we cannot\nendorse a process that leaves so many out in the cold. While we do\ncelebrate our victories and those of our allies in this process, the\nvery real danger is that these exemptions will be used to argue\nagainst us, on the grounds that such \"safety valves\" are enough to\nsolve the problems with DRM or the DMCA's anti-circumvention\nprovisions. They are not. The exemptions process allows users to\npartially control some of their devices and software, but robs them of\nthe necessary tools and the help of third parties. This process\nfurther allows government agencies to co-opt a law nominally about\ncopyright to implement restrictions wholly unrelated to that area of\nlaw. The FSF calls on Congress to end this broken process and repeal\nthe anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA.</p>\n<h3>Media Contacts</h3>\n<p>Joshua Gay\nLicensing &amp; Compliance Manager\nFree Software Foundation\n+1 (617) 542 5942\nlicensing@fsf.org</p>]]></content:encoded>\n <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>\n <dc:creator></dc:creator>\n <dc:rights></dc:rights>\n <dc:date>2015-10-30T21:15:00Z</dc:date>\n <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>\n </item>\n\n\n <item rdf:about=\"http://www.fsf.org/news/gnu-ethical-repo-criteria\">\n <title>GNU ethical criteria for code repositories emphasize privacy, freedom, and copyleft</title>\n <link>http://www.fsf.org/news/gnu-ethical-repo-criteria</link>\n <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Friday, October 16th, 2015 -- Today the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project announced the first version of criteria for evaluating services that host free software source code repositories for distribution and collaborative development. Developed with the leadership of Richard Stallman and GNU volunteers, the criteria provide a framework for code repositories to ensure that they respect their users in a manner consonant with the values of the free software movement, and for users to hold these crucial institutions accountable.\r\n</description>\n <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The criteria emphasize protection of privacy (including accessibility through the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org\">Tor network</a>), functionality without <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/freejs\">nonfree JavaScript</a>, compatibility with copyleft licensing and philosophy, and equal treatment of all users' traffic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/repo-criteria.html\">Published on gnu.org</a>, the criteria are directed at services hosting parts of the GNU operating system, but they're recommended for anyone who wants to use a service for publicly hosting free source code (and optionally, executable programs as well). Moving forward, the GNU community and the FSF will update the criteria in response to technological and social changes in the landscape of code hosting.</p>\n<p>Ethical code hosting is directly important for users of free software, not just developers. Repositories usually provide Web sites with downloadable executable programs compiled from the code they host, and are thus a popular way for users to receive up-to-date copies of free software. The sites also host issue trackers, which users employ to submit bug reports and provide feedback to developers.</p>\n<p>Because they are central to free software in so many ways, the practices of code hosting services have ripples into much of the world of free software, and software in general. Some prominent code hosting services are currently in flux. Gitorious, a code hosting service preferred by many free software developers, was recently assimilated into the up-and-coming Gitlab. SourceForge, a code hosting service that has been central to the free software community for decades, has lost credibility in recent years because of its inclusion of intrusive and deceptive advertising in its Web site and download system.</p>\n<p>Skilled volunteers have been working in recent weeks on evaluations of the repository services Github, Gitlab, SourceForge, GNU Savannah, and more, which the FSF intends to publish soon. The FSF calls on developers to use code hosting services that score at least <em>acceptable</em> per the criteria, and for everyone who cares about free software to share these criteria with the administrators of hosting sites. To discuss the criteria, please use the <a href=\"https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/libreplanet-discuss\">libreplanet-discuss community mailing list</a>.

When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under\nthe GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux\nformed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for\nthe first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination\nis the GNU/Linux system.

The\r\nRYF certification mark means that the product meets the FSF's\r\nstandards in regard to users' freedom, control over the product, and\r\nprivacy.\r\n\r\n</description>\n <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first product of Libiquity to achieve <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/ryf\">RYF\ncertification</a>. The Taurinus X200 has the same architecture and\ncertified software as the Libreboot X200, which was certified in\nJanuary 2015. The Taurinus X200 can be purchased from Libiquity at\n<a href=\"https://shop.libiquity.com/product/taurinus-x200\">https://shop.libiquity.com/product/taurinus-x200</a>.</p>\n<p>The Taurinus X200 is a refurbished and updated laptop based on the\nLenovo ThinkPad X200, with all of the original low-level firmware and\noperating system software replaced. It runs the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html\">FSF-endorsed</a>\n<a href=\"https://trisquel.info/\">Trisquel GNU/Linux</a> operating system and the free software boot\nsystem, <a href=\"http://libreboot.org/\">Libreboot</a>.

It enables\npowering the computer on and off, configuring and upgrading the BIOS,\nwiping the hard drives, reinstalling the operating system, and\nmore. The functionality provided by the ME could be a very useful\nsecurity and recovery measure, but only if the user has control over\nthe software and the ability to install modified versions of it.</p>\n<p>\"With a rise in manufacturing of treacherous computing chips and each\nsuccessive version of Intel's Management Engine becoming more\ntreacherous than the last, it would seem that the public is being\ninundated with hardware that is defective by design. Therefore, it is\nrefreshing to have companies like Libiquity making strong\ncommitments to computer user freedom. The FSF is excited to be able to\naward the use of the RYF certification mark on yet another laptop,\"\nstated FSF's licensing &amp; compliance manager, Joshua Gay.</p>\n<p>Libiquity (a portmanteau of \"liberty\" and \"ubiquity\") defines its\nmission as \"freedom everywhere, in personal electronics and embedded\nsystems.\" In addition to providing hardware that respects your\nfreedom, Libiquity also leads the development of\n<a href=\"http://proteanos.com/\">ProteanOS</a>, an FSF-endorsed distribution, and\nthey work in partnership with and contribute to Libreboot.</p>\n<p>\"Libiquity is proud that its first hardware product, the Taurinus X200\nsubnotebook, has been certified by the FSF to respect its users'\nfreedom and privacy.

The Free Software Awards include the Award for the\r\nAdvancement of Free Software and the Award for Projects of Social\r\nBenefit. The awards are presented each year at the LibrePlanet free\r\nsoftware conference, and at the same time nominations for the next\r\nyear's awards open.</description>\n <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<h3>Award for the Advancement of Free Software</h3>\n<p>The Free Software Foundation Award for the Advancement of Free\nSoftware is presented annually by FSF president Richard Stallman\nto an individual who has made a great contribution to the\nprogress and development of free software, through activities\nthat accord with the spirit of free software.</p>\n<p>Last year, Sébastien Jodogne was recognized with the <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/free-software-award-winners\">Award for\nthe Advancement of Free Software</a> for his work on free\nsoftware medical imaging with his project <a href=\"http://www.orthanc-server.com/\">Orthanc</a>. Jodogne\njoined a prestigious list of previous winners including Matthew\nGarrett, Dr. Fernando Perez, Yukihiro Matsumoto, Rob Savoye, John\nGilmore, Wietse Venema, Harald Welte, Ted Ts'o, Andrew Tridgell,\nTheo de Raadt, Alan Cox, Larry Lessig, Guido van Rossum, Brian\nPaul, Miguel de Icaza, and Larry Wall.</p>\n<h3>Award for Projects of Social Benefit</h3>\n<p>Nominations are also sought for the 2015 Award for Projects of Social\nBenefit.</p>\n<p>The Award for Projects of Social Benefit is presented to the\nproject or team responsible for applying free software, or the\nideas of the free software movement, in a project that\nintentionally and significantly benefits society in other aspects\nof life.</p>\n<p>We look to recognize projects or teams that encourage people to\ncooperate in freedom to accomplish tasks of great social benefit, and\nthose that apply free software ideas and lessons outside the free\nsoftware community. A long-term commitment to one's project (or the\npotential for a long-term commitment) is crucial to this end.</p>\n<p>This award stresses the use of free software in the service of\nhumanity. We have deliberately chosen this broad criterion so\nthat many different areas of activity can be considered. However,\none area that is not included is that of free software\nitself. Projects with a primary goal of promoting or advancing\nfree software are not eligible for this award (we honor\nindividuals working on those projects with our annual Award for\nthe Advancement of Free Software).</p>\n<p>We will consider any project or team that uses free software or\nits philosophy to address a goal important to society. To\nqualify, a project must use free software, produce free\ndocumentation, or use the idea of free software as defined in the\n<a href=\"https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw\">Free Software Definition</a>. Projects that promote or depend on\nthe use of non-free software are not eligible for this\naward. Commercial projects are not excluded, but commercial\nsuccess is not our scale for judging projects.</p>\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"http://www.reglue.org/\">Reglue</a> received the award, in recognition of its\nwork giving GNU/Linux computers to underprivileged children and\ntheir families in Austin, TX. According to Reglue, Austin has an\nestimated 5,000 school-age children who cannot afford a computer\nor Internet access. Since 2005, Reglue has given over 1,100\ncomputers to these children and their families. Reglue's strategy\ndiverts computers from the waste stream, gives them new life with\nfree software, and puts them in the hands of people who need\nthese machines to advance their education and gain access to the\nInternet.</p>\n<p>Other previous winners have included the GNOME Outreach Program\nfor Women (now Outreachy), OpenMRS, GNU Health, Tor, the Internet\nArchive, Creative Commons, Groklaw, the Sahana project, and\nWikipedia.</p>\n<h3>Eligibility</h3>\n<p>In the case of both awards, previous winners are not eligible for\nnomination, but renomination of other previous nominees is\nencouraged. Only individuals are eligible for nomination for the\nAdvancement of Free Software Award (not projects), and only\nprojects can be nominated for the Social Benefit Award (not\nindividuals).

Like all proprietary software, Windows 10 puts those that use it under the thumb of its owner. Free software like the GNU/Linux operating system treats users as equals and gives them control over their digital lives.</description>\n <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft uses draconian laws to prevent anyone from popping the hood on Windows and studying the source code that underlies it. Because of this, the world's most widespread computer system is completely outside the control of its users. This puts Microsoft in a dominant position over its customers, which it takes advantage of to treat them as a product. In fact, Microsoft announced that, with Windows 10, it will begin <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150809111911/http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2015/07/17/windows-10-forced-automatic-updates/\">forcing lower-paying users to test less-secure new updates</a> before giving higher-paying users the option of whether or not to adopt them.</p>\n<p>Increased public scrutiny has forced Microsoft to adjust its advertising to focus on how secure it is and how well it protects privacy. But who does it secure and protect? Certainly not the user. Since Windows 10 is nonfree software, users and independent security experts can't access the source code, so they are forced to take Microsoft's word for it that their computers are safe and their data is being used responsibly. And it hardly seems warranted to trust a company that is reported to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms\">give the NSA special security tip-offs</a> that it could use to crack into Windows computers.</p>\n<p>Advertising companies are surely licking their chops over Windows 10's new privacy policy, which <a href=\"https://edri.org/microsofts-new-small-print-how-your-personal-data-abused/\">asserts the privilege to sell almost any information it wants about users</a>, even creating a unique advertising ID for each user to sweeten the deal.</p>\n<p>By contrast, free software like the GNU/Linux operating system is developed by professional and volunteer communities working transparently, freely sharing their work with each other and the world. Users have meaningful influence over the software development process and complete choice over what code they run. This means the software usually treats them with respect. Even if a free software developer took a page from Microsoft's book and began abusing its users, it would have no way to keep them locked in -- when this happens, independent experts copy the source code, remove the offending bits and help people switch to the user-respecting version.</p>\n<p><strong>Because it is fundamentally insecure and scoffs at privacy, Windows is an open window onto you. Because it locks users and independent experts out of the development process, it is also a locked door to your computer, and only Microsoft has the key. If you are considering replacing your operating system with Windows 10, we hope you switch to GNU/Linux instead. <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/windows/pledge\">Join thousands of others and pledge to try GNU/Linux today</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>The FSF maintains a list of <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.en.html\">endorsed GNU/Linux distributions</a>, and there are myriad resources online for getting started. If you want to try free software but you can't be persuaded to leave Windows quite yet, <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/for-windows.html\">try these free programs that work on Windows</a>. If you are thinking about buying a new computer, check out the laptops we certify through our <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/endorsement/respects-your-freedom\">Respects Your Freedom program</a>. If you're the type that builds their own computer, use <a href=\"https://h-node.org/\">h-node</a>, the community-maintained database of computer components that work well with free software.</p>\n<p>We can't hope to match Microsoft's huge advertising budget, but if you're on social media (see <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/share\">our recommendations</a> for user-respecting social media systems) you can help raise awareness of Windows' abuses and encourage people to switch, in your own words. Help us jam Microsoft's ridiculous #UpgradeYourWorld hashtag by including it in your posts encouraging people to steer clear of Windows.</p>\n<h3>Media Contacts</h3>\n<p>Zak Rogoff<br />\nCampaigns Manager<br />\nFree Software Foundation<br />\n+1 (617) 542 5942<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:campaigns@fsf.org\">&#99;&#97;&#109;&#112;&#97;&#105;&#103;&#110;&#115;&#64;&#102;&#115;&#102;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a></p>]]></content:encoded>\n <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>\n <dc:creator></dc:creator>\n <dc:rights></dc:rights>\n <dc:date>2015-07-30T21:35:00Z</dc:date>\n <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>\n </item>\n\n\n <item rdf:about=\"http://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-invites-the-free-software-community-to-its-30th-birthday-party-on-october-3rd-2015\">\n <title>FSF invites the free software community to its 30th birthday party on October 3rd, 2015</title>\n <link>http://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-invites-the-free-software-community-to-its-30th-birthday-party-on-october-3rd-2015</link>\n <description>BOSTON, Massachusetts, USA -- Friday, July 24, 2015 -- Today the Free Software Foundation (FSF) announced an open invitation to its thirtieth birthday party, to be held in Boston on the evening of Saturday, October 3rd.

For the purposes of determining what you can do with\nspecific works in Ubuntu, this policy should be read together with\nthe license(s) of the relevant packages. For the avoidance of doubt,\nwhere any other license grants rights, this policy does not modify\nor reduce those rights under those licenses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In July 2013, the FSF, after receiving numerous complaints from the\nfree software community, brought serious problems with the policy to\nCanonical's attention. Since then, on behalf of the FSF, the GNU\nProject, and a coalition of other concerned free software activists,\nwe have engaged in many conversations with Canonical's management and\nlegal team proposing and analyzing significant revisions of the\noverall text. We have worked closely throughout this process with the\nSoftware Freedom Conservancy, who provides their expert analysis <a href=\"https://sfconservancy.org/news/2015/jul/15/ubuntu-ip-policy/\">in a\nstatement published today.</a></p>\n<p>While the FSF acknowledges that the first update emerging from that\nprocess solves the most pressing issue with the policy -- its\ninterference with users' rights under the GNU GPL and potentially\nother copyleft licenses covering individual works within Ubuntu -- the\npolicy remains problematic in ways that prevent us from endorsing it\nas a model for others. The FSF will continue to provide feedback to\nCanonical in the days ahead, and urge them to make additional changes.</p>\n<p>Today's \"trump clause\" makes clear that, for example, Canonical's\nrequirement that users recompile Ubuntu packages from source code\nbefore redistributing them is not intended to and does not override\nthe GPL's explicit permission for users to redistribute covered\npackages in binary form (with no recompilation requirement) as long as\nthey also provide the corresponding source.</p>\n<p>While this change handles the situation for works covered by the GPL,\nit does not help works covered by lax permissive licenses (such as the\nX11 license) that do allow such additional restrictions. With that in\nmind, the FSF has urged Canonical to not only respect the GPL but to\nalso change its terms to remove restrictions on <em>any</em> of the free\nworks it distributes, no matter which license covers that software. In\nthe meantime, this is a useful reminder that developers are nearly\nalways better off choosing copyleft licenses like the GPL in order to\nprevent others from imposing arbitrary restrictions on users.</p>\n<p>Further, the patent language in the current policy should be replaced\nwith a real pledge to only make defensive use of patents and to not\ninitiate litigation against other free software developers. The\ntrademark policy should be revised to provide better guidance to\ndownstream distributors so that they can be confident they know\nexactly where and when trademarks need to be removed in order to\ncomply with the policy.</p>\n<p>Canonical, in our conversations, repeatedly expressed that it is their\nfull intention to liberally allow use of their trademarks and patents\nby community projects, and not to interfere with the exercise of\nrights under any copyleft license covering works within Ubuntu. While\nwe appreciate today's development and do see it as a big step in that\ndirection, we hope they will further revise the policy so that users,\nto the greatest extent possible, know their rights in advance rather\nthan having to inquire about them or negotiate them. To this end, it\nwill be important to choose language and terms that emphasize <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/freedom-or-power.html\">freedom\nover power</a> and avoid terms like <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html\">intellectual property</a>, which\nspread bias and confusion.</p>\n<p>It would be helpful for the FSF, as we evaluate the importance of the\nremaining work like this to be done with Canonical in relation to the\nother activities of the FSF's Licensing and Compliance Lab (such as\ndoing GPL enforcement, and developing public educational materials\nabout free software licensing), to know how significantly you, as a\nfree software user, see this policy affecting your rights.

GNU is the only\noperating system developed specifically for the sake of users'\nfreedom. See <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html\">https://www.gnu.org/gnu/the-gnu-project.html</a>.</p>\n<p>In 1992, the essential components of GNU were complete, except for\none, the kernel. When in 1992 the kernel Linux was re-released under\nthe GNU GPL, making it free software, the combination of GNU and Linux\nformed a complete free operating system, which made it possible for\nthe first time to run a PC without non-free software. This combination\nis the GNU/Linux system.
