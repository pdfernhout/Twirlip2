Twirlip Features (wish) List
============================
Version: 2

Author: David Krings

Description of last change: Added features, converted doc to markdown


GENERAL
-------
* allow access from multiple browser clients to one common instance/profile/install
    * have one location where app code and data is located and allow it to be accessed by multiple browsers on multiple systems at the same time (Thunderbird cannot do this and it is major problem!): craft an email client 'server' (see also Lofty Stuff section, might require use of a lightweight web server)
* internationalized / localized (can do German, might be able to ask people for translation to Hindi, Pakistani, Arabic, Russian, Japanese
* use freeware/open source dictionaries / thesaurus
* provide menu system
* save last state for UI
* support full screen view (browser tab full screen)
* contain app and data in one folder/directory (intention is to make backup and moving easier)
* override browser behavior at all times so that backspace does not navigate back
* set autofill to off on (all?) text fields
* allow for tagging any content
    * entire item
    * portion of content
* field level help

ACCOUNT SETUP
-------------
* setup wizard for new email account
    * allow for selecting free email services (GMX, GMAIL, WEB.DE, HOTMAIL/OUTLOOK, YAHOO, others)
        * ask for desired user name and have wizard check availability, propose alternatives
        * have option to check all free services for desired name
        * if name is available ask for password
        * if password is acceptable create account
* manual account creation
* keep incoming / outgoing servers as part of each account
* import account settings from Thunderbird profile
* add option to account to force text only / HTML only send/receive (means convert HTML content to text in either way)
* send test email to account (send and receive until success or give up and report error, think printer test page)
* associate language with account

SECURITY / USERS
----------------
* allow for password / 2 factor ? protection of entire app
* make it so that Twirlip is considered as "safe app" for Gmail (currently, Thunderbird requires dropping Gmail security)
* do not execute JS in messages, or any other active content like Flash
* store email account passwords
* allow for master password for email account password lookup
* add option to not allow clicking on a link

    * from 3rd party with updates
    * by declaring a received email as spam
        * by sender
        * by (portion of) subject
    * move to spam folder
    * allow for personal whitelist (will only be effective when email server does not already delete spam)
* check links against known bad domains (Spybot has a list of bad domains, not sure what the licensing is and if it can be reused freely; could make Spybot installation a prerequsisite and import list, will only be an option for Windows)

RECEIVING EMAIL
---------------
* get headers only
* download entire message
* threaded view
* column (grid) view
* get email on demand from one / all accounts

VIEWING EMAIL
-------------
* allow for text only view

* provide tri-pane view (accounts on left full height, folder content at top, preview at bottom)
* provide tabbed interface within browser tab
* allow for opening email in new browser tab (edit mode) - setting? context menu?
* print email (assumed that this will be handled through the browser's print capabilities)

EDITING EMAIL
-------------
* have three editor options (general default setting, but with per email account override): plain text, 'rich text' (bold, underline, font size - nothing else), full HTML
* show / hide editor characters (CR/LF, tab, space)
* attach files
* attach files by uploading to file share services (Hightail, Dropbox, etc)
* type as you go spell checking

    * ideally by drag & drop with confirmation
    * update any filters that might be impacted
* folder structure with theoretically unlimited levels (force limit if performance suffers too much / implementation might get too convoluted)
* query based folders across accounts (e.g. show all emails with "cheesecake" in subject line in one folder), query based folders are views only, emails do not reside in them
* on demand purge of email based on
    * age
    * size

    * purge setting for entire Twirlip instance (global default)
* drag & drop messages from one folder to the other
